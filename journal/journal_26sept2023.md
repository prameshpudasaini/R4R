## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Things I found interesting in this session: the concept of Data Management Plan (DMP), the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, and the subtle differences between various licenses.

### Bud:
This session helped me understand the importance of a DMP in a project, especially in a GitHub repository. I created [this DMP](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/vehicle_reidentification/blob/main/docs/Data_Management_Plan.md) for my research repo.

### Thorn:
None.

## Additional thought
I will keep updating the DMP I developed for my research repo.

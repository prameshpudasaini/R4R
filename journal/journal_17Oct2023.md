## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I have been using GitHub (with GitHub Desktop) for version control in my research and project repos for over 2 years now. Other version control tools I have used include Overleaf, Google Docs, and Word's track changes. I found the explanation of Git and GitHub and the concept of version control particularly interesting in this session. Git Large File Storage (LFS) was also new to me.

### Bud:
I am already using GitHub in my research projects. Since the start of the FOSS sessions, I have been trying to shift to doing Git actions using CLI. I would also like to try GIT LFS.

### Thorn:
Reverting commit while working on a team project is something I have not fully understood. I need more hands-on practice with Git via CLI.

## Additional thought
Different Git actions such as clone, pull, push, merge, fork, commit, etc. were well-explained.

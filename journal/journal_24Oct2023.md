# Learner Log Entry #7

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Hans Plesser's definitions and distinction between repeatibility, replicability, and reproducibility were interesting. I am familiar with Conda, but Nextflow and Mamba were new to me. 

### Bud:
I followed Michele's hands-on reproducibility tutorial on CyVerse Cloud Shell, but I need to revisit this tutorial. I have experienced a lot of issues with package dependency while working with Python and Conda on my computer and virtual machine in our research center. I will try using pip and explore requirements.txt in the future.

### Thorn:
I did not understand much of the workflow tutorial with Nextflow. I need to revisit this one at my own pace. Also, debugging dependency management is something I have not yet tried.

## Additional thought
Scrolling in CyVerse Cloud Shell using Ctrl + b and then [ was weird!

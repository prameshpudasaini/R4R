# Learner Log Entry #4

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I found the concepts of project governance and research objects interesting. I previously thought only published articles, data used for research, and GitHub repos constituted a research object. The example project structure is exactly what I needed in my working repositories.

### Bud:
I created this [Governance and Operations Document](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/vehicle_reidentification/blob/main/docs/Governance_Operations.md) in my working research repo. I will be working on creating a project structure as well so that others can get an idea about how code scripts and data are sequentially organized for data collection, pre-processing, processing, modeling, and analyzing results.

### Thorn:
I did not fully understand the importance of Governance and Operations Document in, say, a small research repository on which you are working alone.

## Additional thought
None.

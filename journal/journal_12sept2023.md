# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Things I found interesting in this session: using Linux in Windows, command line interface (CLI), and the concept of version control using Git. This session also explored the subtle difference between fork and clone. Also, the use of GPT 4.00 seemed promising for doing preliminary data analysis and modeling.

### Bud:
I already have GitHub repositories set up for my research and projects, but I have been using GitHub Desktop to handle version control. I will try to make commits and push using Git and CLI.

### Thorn: 
I was confused about the Unix CLI and Windows Powershell but finally got Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) working. The process of accessing and editing files seems a bit complex; I need to give this a try in my research repo. 

## Additional thought
This was a great start to the R4R FOSS session. Throughout these FOSS sessions, I will be working on [this repository](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/vehicle_reidentification) to implement the things I learned.

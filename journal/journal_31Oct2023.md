## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Things I found interesting in this session: difference between containers and virtual machines and the concept of Docker. I was intrigued by the fact that containers do not have an inherent OS in them. I have used Docker once before to test an app I created in R Shiny and deploy the app on the main website.

### Bud:
I will give Docker a try again to deploy an updated version of an R Shiny app I was working on last year.

### Thorn:
I tried following Jeff's hands-on tutorial and was able to replicate his docker commands/outputs. However, there were many new concepts related to Docker in this FOSS session. So, I need to revist this tutorial again at my own pace.

## Additional thought
None.

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The most interesting thing in this session was creating a DOI of a GitHub repo using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Also, the idea of mkdocs was new to me.

### Bud:
Following this session and inspired by Jeff's personal website, I created my personal portfolio/website to organize my projects, research, updates, and thoughts. I bought the domain [pudasaini.com](https://pudasaini.com/), created a GitHub page website, hosted the domain on GitHub, linked the domain and GitHub page website, and used the Jekyll Theme for front-end interface.

### Thorn:
None.

## Additional thought
I will be updating my website with my projects, research, and updates. Also, a personal website is a great place to write blog posts and organize one's thoughts.
